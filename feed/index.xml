<p>Hello, everyone !</p>



<p>We&#8217;re so excited to announce that we are kickstaring a new activity here at HMS Harmony!</p>



<p>Introducing the HMS Harmony Writing Fest, where we are encouraging EVERYONE to write and post their themed fics online! </p>



<p>Our first theme is… Harry&#8217;s 40th Birthday!! July 31, 2020 is Harry Potter&#8217;s 40th birthday.</p>



<p>We are asking YOU to write a story, NO restrictions on the length, and post it anywhere by Tuesday, July 28th. You can post it on Tumblr, Archive of Our Own, Fanfiction.Net, here in drabbles, your own website… really, we want you to post it wherever your heart desires!</p>



<p>We want to encourage all non-published fanfic authors to try their hand on writing as well! Just a few simple rules:</p>



<p>1. MUST be Harmony, of course</p>



<p>2. MUST be about Harry&#8217;s 40th birthday</p>



<p>3. MUST be posted online in a publicly accessible place by Tuesday, July 28, 2020</p>



<p>4. NO length requirements! </p>



<p>Note: If you are going to post on Ao3, we have created a collection called HMS Harmony Discord Writing Fest: Harry&#8217;s 40th Birthday which you can post to. </p>



<p>Link is: https://archiveofourown.org/collections/HMS_Harmony_Discord_Writing_Fest_Harrys_40th_Birthday.</p>



<p>We will be compiling a list of all submissions and sharing it with the server on July 31st! To be included in this list, please fill out this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKxgELWaAhposn3vAo-OErTp5r7vA7X4Tib5Hx5keEkxtsaQ/viewform?usp=sf_link</p>
